    "# Day 1: Calorie Counting\n",
    "\n",
    "The jungle must be too overgrown and difficult to navigate in vehicles or access from the air; the Elves' expedition traditionally goes on foot. As your boats approach land, the Elves begin taking inventory of their supplies. One important consideration is food - in particular, the number of **Calories** each Elf is carrying (your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Elves take turns writing down the number of Calories contained by the various meals, snacks, rations, etc. that they've brought with them, one item per line. Each Elf separates their own inventory from the previous Elf's inventory (if any) by a blank line.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose the Elves finish writing their items' Calories and end up with the following list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    1000\n",
    "    2000\n",
    "    3000\n",

    "    10000\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This list represents the Calories of the food carried by five Elves:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first Elf is carrying food with `1000`, `2000`, and `3000` Calories, a total of **`6000`** Calories.\n",
    "- The second Elf is carrying one food item with **`4000`** Calories.\n",
    "- The third Elf is carrying food with `5000` and `6000` Calories, a total of **`11000`** Calories.\n",
    "- The fourth Elf is carrying food with `7000`, `8000`, and `9000` Calories, a total of **`24000`** Calories.\n",
    "- The fifth Elf is carrying one food item with **`10000`** Calories.\n",

    "In case the Elves get hungry and need extra snacks, they need to know which Elf to ask: they'd like to know how many Calories are being carried by the Elf carrying the **most** Calories. In the example above, this is **`24000`** (carried by the fourth Elf).\n",
