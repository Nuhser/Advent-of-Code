# Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains solutions for the **Advent of Code 2021** challenges.

Each day consists of one input file containing my personal randomly generated puzzle input and one IPython Notebook containing the task description as well as my solutions for part 1 and 2.

This year's challenges:

1. Sonar Sweep
2. Dive!
3. Binary Diagnostic
4. Giant Squid
5. Hydrothermal Venture
6. Lanternfish

*More tasks will be added as advent moves on...*
